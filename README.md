# TattvaTCG
A Unity Trading Card Game (Under Development)

This game will be a Deck Building Card Battler where players will compete against one another with using custom built decks. 
Each player will control a special Champion with unique cards, abilities and a special guard which protects the champion until defeated.
While the champions are defended, players can amass an army by summoning minions and heroes or by capturing powerful creatures in a neutral zone.
Once the champion's guard is defeated they are open to attack by the opposing champion and their army. 
The first player to bring the opposing champion's health down to zero wins the battle!
