## TattvaTCG
TattvaTCG (working title) is a Trading Card Game similar to Legends of Runeterra and Ascension. Cards are collected and traded as tokenized assets on a Blockchain.

At the beginning of the match, a unique Champion is summoned for each active player. This Champion includes unique active and passive abilities and determines which cards are available to be used in your deck for the match. In addition to the Champion, a Defense Tower is summoned for each player which must destroyed before that player's Champion becomes vulnerable to attack. There are several neutral elite Minions on the battleground which, when defeated, can be added to the defeating player's deck. Thus the match is typically broken into 2 stages - first resource gathering (Econ) then later Combat. 

Each round players take turns summoning Minions, casting Spells and taking other available actions. One player is granted Initiative while the other is consider Reactive, swapping each round. The round flow is broken up into 5 Phases illustrated in this [flow diagram](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/JoshFlash/TattvaTCG/master/Assets/TCG%20Round%20Flow.png?token=AAV6F3DI5OGM4EHYT5W7BG3BZOZPW). Prep, Burst, Spell, Ability, Recovery. Players take turns taking the actions that are available to them in each phase. If no actions are available to a player in a given turn, then that players turn is skipped automatically. This is especially important in the Econ stage where rounds should be passing more quickly.
